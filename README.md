# bootstrap5 markdown-editor

This is a minimalistic markdown editor build with [marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify), 
[jquery](https://jquery.com/) and [bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/). \
Most solutions that I found had poor experience from mobile devices or were too complex for a project that I was working on, so I decided to make my own minimalistic editor.\
In this editor you can switch from `edit mode` to `view mode` to render the content from the text area as markdown and viceversa.
